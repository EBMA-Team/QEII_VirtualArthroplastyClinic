# Introduction

The following online book contains chapters representing the three components of an EBMA study viability report;

1.  Question Check - statement of the question and associated hypotheses. Uses the PICOS question framework to work through each component of a question and discuss pertinent literature to inform the relevant components of a proposed study.

2.  Viability Assessment - a comprehensive review of the logistical and statistical elements of the study plan and aligning them to the resources available for the completion of a proposed study.

3.  Study Plan - assuming that the question is agreed by key stakeholders and sponsor, and that the viability assessment has returned a favourable review, a plan of action is presented to commence the proposed investigation.

With this modular approach to study planning, poorly framed questions or insurmountable risks to project completion can be identified early and the fallacy of sunk investment can be mitigated.
