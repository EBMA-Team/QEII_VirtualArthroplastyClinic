    "text": "6.2 Related Work\nThe SHARKS governance report [link] shows that PROMs trajectories over time can be highly variable in the QEII population and that a demarcation could be established for patients with lower scores that should be prioritised for more intensive review, versus patients that are doing well and could be reviewed as required when circumstances change. This is apparent for both total knee (Figure 22) and total hip (Figure 24).\nAdditional work from the SHARKS registry has identified PROMs-based phenotypes in total knee arthroplasty cases at baseline assessment (McGill et al. 2025) that may also inform triaging of cases that could warrant different forms of follow up after hospital discharge.\nPlanning currently underway for an analysis of the tibiofemoral instability cohort with respect to case-mixture adjustment, will also have implications for the proposed activity. By constructing a case-mixture adjustment model for postoperative scores in the arthroplasty cohorts of SHARKS, an individualised expectation for PROMs scores can be generated and used to benchmark patient responses at the selected followup timepoints.",

    "text": "9.1 Virtual Clinic Composition\nA summary of related studies has been tabled below. The setting, sample size, components of the intervention and a summary of results is available for review.\n\n\n\nTable 9.1: Summary of virtual clinic composition\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nThe components and definition of a virtual clinic intervention varies substantially between studies and clinical contexts as shown in Table 9.1. The capacity of the health system provider to incorporate specialised infrastructure to conduct enrolment, patient messaging and clinician alerts broadly determines what methodology is used for both the intervention and the evaluation of the service.\nAlthough web-based followup has been published for some time (Marsh et al. 2014), it has not been the most popular approach for virtual clinic followup, although there has been one report of a platform that has been in use for some time in the UK (Parkes et al. 2019). A combination of patient-reported outcomes - either specially designed for the purpose (NJ Preston et al. 2023; N. Preston et al. 2019) or popular standardised measures (e.g. Oxford, EQ5D) (Richards, Stoddart, and Bolland 2022; El Ashmawy et al. 2021) collected on paper and returned via mail - combined with a radiograph (NJ Preston et al. 2023; Richards, Stoddart, and Bolland 2022; Joseph, Nagy, and Fountain 2021) captured at a convenient location appears to be the mainstay approach. Others have used very detailed patient engagement programs with gamification and bidirectional messaging (Mehta et al. 2020), or a mobile-based application (Chahal et al. 2024). The key distinction between the literature and the proposed approach is that the use of web-based patient registries with uni-directional messaging to support patients after discharge from in-person care is relatively rare, with just one paper (Ulivi et al. 2021) using this method during the covid pandemic, and even then it was largely facilitated with PROMs collection by phone.",

One study (Mehta et al. 2020), targeted patients with a Risk Assessment and Prediction Tool (RAPT) score that placed them in the at-risk category for facility discharge, before randomising them to a sophisticated patient engagement platform or to usual care. Others have relied on a clinician decision at a face-to-face consultation early in the followup process to determine if the patient is “low-risk” or appropriate for virtual clinic followup (Batten, Murphy, and Keenan 2017), while more established clinic models have transitioned to offering virtual follow up routinely (Fisher et al. 2020). The AOA guidelines for followup (Broughton et al. 2019) may provide a starting point for determining patients “at-risk”, however the risk profile of each of these points in the context of a virtual clinic could be debated;\n\nYoung patients (less than 60yo)\nActive patients (patients engaging in sport, manual work etc)\nHeavy patients (more than 100kg)\nMetal on metal articulations\nModular neck devices\nNew implant designs yet to establish a proven track record\nRevision implants and those with lysis or previous infection\nImplants known to be associated with higher incidence of problems",

    "text": "9.2 Proposed Intervention (Draft)\nThe proposed intervention contains two key components. The first is embedded within the SHARKS registry and comprises the routine PROMs followups designed into the KneeArthritis and HipArthroplasty cohorts. The key difference being the lack of 6month followup for the HA cases.\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nFigure 9.1: Proposed virtual clinic workflow (intervention)\n\n\n\n\n9.2.1 Discharge from department care at 6 weeks\nThere would need to be some communication between the clinic staff and the VC system that a patient had been discharged into virtual clinic at the 6 week appointment. Routine discharge to virtual clinic (unless otherwise directed) would be a much easier system to administer within the registry platform.\n\n\n9.2.2 Followup schedule\n\n\n\n\n\n\nFigure 9.2: Followup schedule for SHARKS cohorts - KneeArthritis and HipArthroplasty\n\n\n\nThe current followup schedule for SHARKS is illustrated in Figure 9.2, with the pathology-specific score (OHS or OKS) on the bottom row. Considering the more clinical nature of the proposed virtual service, a 6month timepoint may be appropriate to add and discharge criteria for the virtual clinic added to allow patients the ability to opt-out of futher followups once they achieve an acceptable score on the PROMs pack. This may help to encourage patient compliance with the service and further refine the concept of patient-led care in this context. Contingencies for escalation if patients do not engage at least once may need to be considered as per (Batten, Murphy, and Keenan 2017).\n\n\n9.2.3 Adjunct Pathways\nThe adjunct pathway (left side of Figure 9.1) is a persistent portal for a patient enrolled in the virtual clinic to provide feedback or report a change in circumstance that may fall outside of the scheduled followup touch points incorporated into the registry system. A large study of total hip arthroplasties (Cassidy, O hEireamhoin, and Beverland 2019), detected 80 revision cases, in a series of 4802 procedures and 45% of these were revised after self-referral back to the treating surgeon, with nearly all of the remainder re-presenting after referral from other care providers. They concluded that well-performing implants can be discharged from their first postoperative review as long as there is a robust system of self-referral in place. The presence of an pathway for communication from patient to health service varies depending on which virtual clinic model is reviewed in the literature.",

This margin represents the maximum acceptable increase in adverse outcomes that would still consider the virtual clinic approach acceptable given its potential benefits (convenience, cost-effectiveness, resource utilization).",

    "section": "11.1 Patient Engagement",
    "text": "11.1 Patient Engagement\nOne of the key challenges of maintaining a viable virtual service in following arthroplasty patients after surgery is their willingness to engage with the system. The relevant literature reports variable results in this regard.\nAn Australian implementation of a virtual clinic (Lovelock et al. 2018) reported 36% compliance (see Table 9.1) in a pool of 1405 contactable patients for arthroplasty followup over a 2-year period. These results should be interpreted in the context of the virtual clinic service which was relatively rigid in terms of the schedule and involved both paper-based PROMs completion and a radiograph. Modifying the clinic (intervention) to be more patient led and less onerous at each “appointment”, may increase patient engagement rates. In contrast, a similar virtual service implemented in the UK (Batten, Murphy, and Keenan 2017) reported a much higher compliance rate (89.4%) from a sample of 151 patients eligible (Table 9.1). The main difference between the two studies was that Batten et al implemented a clear escalation pathway for patients that had not replied and were followed up by phone by a dedicated arthroplasty nurse within the department.",

    "section": "11.2 Safety and Efficacy",
    "text": "11.2 Safety and Efficacy\nThere is a lack of standardisation across interventions and studies with respect to quantification of sensitivity and specificity of virtual clinic interventions and the ability to detect deterioration in clinical status in a timely manner. The studies summarised in Table 9.1 do offer some clues.\nA UK study with paper PROMs and radiographs in 5380 patients (hip or knee arthroplasty) (Fisher et al. 2020) reported no documented admissions resulting from a missed complication at virtual review. The Australian implementation reported one revision case that appeared in between virtual appointments (Lovelock et al. 2018). A followup study (Lim, Du, and Calligeros 2022) reported an estimated saving of $250K AUD and 300 review hours from the outpatient clinic by switching 30% of appointments to the virtual clinic over the review period, while others have reported cost savings and reduced travel requirements for patients randomised to a web-based virtual clinic (Marsh et al. 2014). A randomised multicentre study from Germany (Schöner et al. 2024) reported improved patient-reported outcomes in patients randomised to virtual clinic compared to usual care (Table 9.1).\nTo-date, there has been no detailed assessment of adverse events or readmissions using a virtual clinic model as proposed, with some positive indications of the safety and efficacy of virtual clinics reported in the literature.",
