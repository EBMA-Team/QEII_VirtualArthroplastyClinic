    "text": "6.2 Related Work\nThe SHARKS governance report [link] shows that PROMs trajectories over time can be highly variable in the QEII population and that a demarcation could be established for patients with lower scores that should be prioritised for more intensive review, versus patients that are doing well and could be reviewed as required when circumstances change. This is apparent for both total knee (Figure 22) and total hip (Figure 24).\nAdditional work from the SHARKS registry has identified PROMs-based phenotypes in total knee arthroplasty cases at baseline assessment (McGill et al. 2025) that may also inform triaging of cases that could warrant different forms of follow up after hospital discharge.",
